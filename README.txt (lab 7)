TREES

Advantages:

1) The tree is self-balancing and doesn't require extra work to keep it "under 
   control."

Disadvantages:

1) It is slower to insert an item into a tree than into a hash table.

2) It is slower to look up and find an item in a tree than in a hash table.


HASH TABLES

Advantages:

1) It is faster to insert an item into a hash table than into a tree.

2) It is faster to look up and find an item in a hash table than in a tree.

Disadvantages:

1) Effective hash trees are more difficult to implement than effective 
   self-balancing trees.
   
   
* In order to compare hash tables and trees in more depth, we could measure
actions such as swapping and deleting items. *
